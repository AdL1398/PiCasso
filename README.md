# PiCasso
PiCasso is the service migration platform whihc is a core component of the UMOBILE architecture(http://www.umobile-project.eu). PiCasso assumes a network provider-centric model where the provider is in full control of the communication infrastructure. PiCasso platform takes advantage of three fundamental concepts: Light weight virtualization technology, Opportunistic service deployment and Edge network computing. Our architecture is underpinned by lightweight dockerised services, built as self-contained VMs coupled with a semantic naming scheme. These services can be seamlessly deployed and executed across all compatible devices within the UMOBILE network (e.g., a hotspot). We take advantage of caching and name-based routing to allow users to access nearby copies of the service. Furthermore, thanks to the semantic naming scheme, a user can request a service that matches certain criteria.
